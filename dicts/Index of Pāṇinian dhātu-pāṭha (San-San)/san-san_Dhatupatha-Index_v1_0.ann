This text is based on the following editions:
1. Aṣṭādhyāyī of Pāṇini in Roman Transliteration by Sumitra M. Katre // Pāṇinīya-dhātupāṭhaḥ - University of Texas Press, Austin, 1987.
2. Dhātupāṭhaḥ, J. L. Shastri - Motilal Banarsidas, Delhi, 2002.
3. Pāṇinīyo Dhātupāṭhaḥ - http://www.vedamu.org/Sankrit/eBooks/DownloadFile.asp?Filename=Dhaatupaatha.zip
Special features of this text:
1. The text is accentuated according to Pāṇini's accentuation-rules using Vedic svara-marks (i.e. only sannataraḥ and svaritaḥ are marked).
2. All vowel anubandhas (its) are marked with anunāsika-sign according to Pāṇini's rules.
3. The avagraha after a dhātu is the sign of compound separation (as in pada-pāṭha) and not of the elision of short 'a' (as in contemporary usage).
4. Verbal roots (dhātu) were enumerated according to the following principle: every dhātu and every variation of dhātu must have its own number, all known varieties of roots must be included in text and not excluded. There are many styles of dhātu enumeration in different editions and they don't agree with each other. In this enumeration every dhātu has two numbers: a number of its gaṇa (class) an its number within this gaṇa.
5. Three kinds of brackets are used in this text:
() - words in such brackets are variations of the text in other editions.
[] - words in such brackets in index are anuvṛtti from preceding lines. Anuvṛtti is a part of a preceding rule wich must be remembered in order to understand the following rules.
{} - words in such brackets are variations of dhātu exactly known from other sources but not found in three editions on wich this text is based.
